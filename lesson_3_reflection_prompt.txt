When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When colaborating with multiple people or using different machines at different locations. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To be able to see and agree with changes at the repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Internal GitHub clone, which refers to the original GitHub project.
    Clone: Copying the entire repo to a local machine.
    branches: Creates an alternative version of the code aside from the main one (master)	

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To be able to check the differences between the two branches, origin/master and master.
